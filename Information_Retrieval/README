FileIndexBuilder builds index of documents in src/documents.

SimpleSearchRanker uses index above to produce output for queries in src/topics/air.topics, output to out/retrieved.txt in the format that trec_eval can recognise.

All the paths and files can be changed by changing the string constant at the top of the corresponding .java file.
